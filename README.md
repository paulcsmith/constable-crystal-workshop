# Constable Crystal

A simple rewrite of Constable using Lucky

## Installation

* Clone this repo
* **If you’re on macOS** you’ll need to install the Lucky CLI through brew
https://github.com/luckyframework/web#installation. This should also install
crystal and everything crystal needs, but if not see instructions here to
install Crystal: https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/
* **If you’re on Linux** you’ll need to build the Lucky CLI and add it to your path.
I’m not exactly sure what that will entail, but it will be something like
cloning the lucky CLI repo https://github.com/luckyframework/cli then running
the commands here:
https://github.com/luckyframework/homebrew-lucky/blob/master/generate.cr#L12-L16
and then putting the generated executable in your path. If you are on Linux and
would like to update the README with installation instructions that would be
great!
* Run `shards` to install the dependencies

You will probably already have these, but you’ll also need:

* Postgres
* Yarn
* Heroku CLI


## Usage

Run `lucky dev`
